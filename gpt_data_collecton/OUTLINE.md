# Data Collection Procedure Outline

For each prompt, split it into 2 procedures:

1. Create the initial prompt, then ask the model if bias was present, then get a renewed answer\
2. Create the initial prompt, ask the model what assumptions were made, tell the model to create a renewed answer based on correcting those assumptions.
   Run each prompt through the system 10 times, 5 for each procedure.
