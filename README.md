Unsure whether the model is accurately giving which answer it believes in -- topic modelling is returning interesting results:\

Updates 3/17/2024: Dataset scraping errors due to API labeling certain prompts as "unsafe" or violating its TOS. Added a try/catch to eliminate this error. Generated a datset of ~3000 records for ~300 prompts for EDA. Continuing to use Gemini for preliminary dataset building. Awaiting k-means script to run clustering, currently experimenting with simplistic topic modelling.
